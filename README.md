# web-APIs-codequiz

## Description

For this challenge it was my job to create a code quiz that dynamically rendered information to the page based on user events. The quiz was timed and score was based on that time. This repository houses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of the quiz page on load and the quiz page during one of the questions.
